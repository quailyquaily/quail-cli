2. Authorize the application.

### Retrieve Current User Information

```

Get the details of the currently authenticated user.

### Post Operations

#### Upsert a Post

```bash
$ quail-cli post upsert your_markdown_file.md -l your_list_slug
```

in which,

- `your_markdown_file.md` is the path to the markdown file.
- `your_list_slug` is the slug of the list where the post will be created or updated. For example, if the list URL is `https://quaily.com/my_list`, then `your_list_slug` is `my_list`.

quail-cli will read the frontmatter from the markdown file to create or update a post. If the post does not exist, it will be created. If it exists, it will be updated.

Here is an example of a markdown file:

```markdown
---
title: "Here is the title"
slug: your-post-slug
datetime: 2024-09-30 18:42
summary: "This is a summary of the post."
tags: tag1, tag2, tag3
cover_image_url: "your-image-url.jpg"
---

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

> -- Arthur C. Clarke

This is the body of the post.

    int main() {
        printf("Hello, World!");
        return 0;
    }

## Section Title

This is the last section of the post.
```

#### Publish/Unpublish/Deliver/Delete a Post

```bash
$ quail-cli post publish -l your_list_slug -p your_post_slug
```

```bash
$ quail-cli post unpublish -l your_list_slug -p your_post_slug
```

```bash
$ quail-cli post deliver -l your_list_slug -p your_post_slug
```

```bash
$ quail-cli post delete -l your_list_slug -p your_post_slug
```

## Configuration

By default, `quail-cli` reads from `$HOME/.config/quail-cli/config.yaml`. if the file does not exist, it will be created after the first login.

You can specify a different configuration file by using the `--config` flag.

```bash
$ quail-cli --config /path/to/config.yaml
```

### Configuration File Example

```yaml
# DO NOT modify `app` section, quail-cli will manage it.
app:
  access_token: ""
  expiry: ""
  refresh_token: ""
  token_type: ""
post:
  # frontmatter_mapping is used to map the frontmatter keys
  # for this example:
  # you can use`featureImage` in the frontmatter and it will be mapped to `cover_image_url`
  frontmatter_mapping:
    cover_image_url: featureImage
```
